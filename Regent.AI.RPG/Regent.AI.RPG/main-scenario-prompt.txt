Let's play a RPG scenario. 
You are the DM and will set the scene and guide me through this short adventure. 

The setting 
It is set at Meli√° Palma Bay Hotell in Palma, Mallorca during contemporary time. A hot late summer weekend a Swedish consultant company is holding a conference about AI.

The story
should be about an AI conference gone terribly wrong and I as the participant has to make it out of Palma alive.
